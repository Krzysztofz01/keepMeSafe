# KeepMeSafe
Security is key in today's internet world. With the KeepMeSafe app, you can generate a random string that meets all password security requirements. You can also check if your currently used passwords are safe. The algorithm will analyze the length and type of characters used. The application will also check whether your password belongs to the group of "frequently encountered passwords" or whether it has not been leaked.

The possibility of comparing passwords with passwords from leaks is possible thanks to: [danielmiessler/SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)

## Technologies
Early on, KeepMeSafe used .NET technology and ran as a Windows Forms desktop application. The project has been rewritten as a web application using the Angular framework. The project was implemented using Nginx as a web server and Docker for containerization.
